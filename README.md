My production Laptop install for doing Dev, Ubuntu Based,  Using Ansible.

## Eternally WorksForMe

This is really just meant so I can install my whole own machine for work
with a one-liner, Handy for an update, and upgrade of machines a recovery
from backups or simply for a new machine that a client asks me to use.

Probably won't be useful for you. But if you can scavenge something here:
kudos, it is GPL, enjoy!


## What does it contains?

My dev env mostly: Emacs, StumpWM, Eclipse, Chromium, VirtualBox, Vagrant,
Several Languages & Libs, LaTeX and lots of small stuff


## Why base it on Ubuntu?

Of the several stable distros I'd consider for a work machine, ubuntu just
kind of won the plurality vote: projects on the fring of linux itself
(coming from other OSes) tend to make packages for it.

I do not use unity tho, I just like Tiling Window Managers better.


## Why Ansible ?

Figured I'd rather do this on Some DevOps tool Like ansible, puppet, salt or
chef: to avoid re-inventing that wheel.

Ansible is just the one I know better between those.
